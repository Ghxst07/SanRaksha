How might we leverage AI to revolutionise healthcare delivery, bridging critical gaps in accessibility, affordability, and quality while ensuring inclusive care across diverse geographic and socioeconomic barriers?

<h2>Current Challenges</h2> <br>
<h3>Maternal and Child Health</h3> <br>
-33% of children under 5 are underweight, and 60% suffer from anemia<br>
-Delayed detection of high-risk pregnancies leads to complications<br>
-Dietary recommendations fail to consider locally available, culturally accepted foods, limiting adoption<br>
<h3>Lack of Awareness & Access to Healthcare Schemes</h3><br>
-State and Central governments have provided 15+ schemes for reducing healthcare costs/burden<br>
-As of 2017-2018, only 14.1% of the rural population had health insurance coverage<br>
-Lack of awareness of schemes, applicability, and application process is the major hurdle in using these benefits<br>
<h3>Infrastructure Gaps</h3><br>
-Doctor-patient ratio of ~1:1456 and ~1:25,000 in rural areas<br>
-Delayed diagnosis and treatment leading to preventable complications<br>
-Rural doctors lack instant access to best practices and on-time government guidelines<br>
<h2>What Success would mean for the above challenges</h2><br>
<h3>Maternal and Child Health</h3><br>
-Enabling ASHA workers and ANMs to optimise local knowledge to provide personalised dietary advice<br>
-Early detection of high-risk pregnancies based on the health of the mother<br>
-Support in data collection and data management in terms of patient history<br>
<h3>Lack of Awareness & Access to Healthcare Schemes</h3><br>
-Increased awareness to State and Central government schemes<br>
-Automated mapping to schemes based on eligibility<br>
-Simplified application processes<br>
-Interoperability across DPIs for simplified access<br>
<h3>Infrastructure Gaps</h3><br>
-Access to medical guidelines, treatment recommendations, and best practices<br>
-Shorter timelines in preliminary diagnostic and administrative tasks<br>
-Increased doctor bandwidth to serve more patients<br>
