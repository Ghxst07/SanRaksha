How might we leverage AI to revolutionise healthcare delivery, bridging critical gaps in accessibility, affordability, and quality while ensuring inclusive care across diverse geographic and socioeconomic barriers?

Current Challenges
Maternal and Child Health
33% of children under 5 are underweight, and 60% suffer from anemia
Delayed detection of high-risk pregnancies leads to complications
Dietary recommendations fail to consider locally available, culturally accepted foods, limiting adoption
Lack of Awareness & Access to Healthcare Schemes
State and Central governments have provided 15+ schemes for reducing healthcare costs/burden
As of 2017-2018, only 14.1% of the rural population had health insurance coverage
Lack of awareness of schemes, applicability, and application process is the major hurdle in using these benefits
Infrastructure Gaps
Doctor-patient ratio of ~1:1456 and ~1:25,000 in rural areas
Delayed diagnosis and treatment leading to preventable complications
Rural doctors lack instant access to best practices and on-time government guidelines
What Success would mean for the above challenges
Maternal and Child Health
Enabling ASHA workers and ANMs to optimise local knowledge to provide personalised dietary advice
Early detection of high-risk pregnancies based on the health of the mother
Support in data collection and data management in terms of patient history
Lack of Awareness & Access to Healthcare Schemes
Increased awareness to State and Central government schemes
Automated mapping to schemes based on eligibility
Simplified application processes
Interoperability across DPIs for simplified access
Infrastructure Gaps
Access to medical guidelines, treatment recommendations, and best practices
Shorter timelines in preliminary diagnostic and administrative tasks
Increased doctor bandwidth to serve more patients
